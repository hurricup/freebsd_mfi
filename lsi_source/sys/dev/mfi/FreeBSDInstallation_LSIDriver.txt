Installing LSI Drivers and Software under FreeBSD
===================================================

   This section provides detailed instructions for installing the LSI driver
   under a FreeBSD operating system.

   The following topics are included in this section:
   o  Driver Installation for FreeBSD
   o  Updating Drivers under FreeBSD



Driver Installation for FreeBSD
===============================

Note: Before installing the LSI driver, you must have already installed your
      MegaRAID controller in the system. Consult the installation guide that
      came with your controller for how to do this.
      You can download the installation guide from:
          http://www.lsi.com/channel/ChannelDownloads.


This section provides details about how to install the driver for your
MegaRAID controller under FreeBSD.

   o If the VDs you have created are your boot device, you install the driver
     for the controller as you install FreeBSD.

   o If the operating system is already installed on a unit connected to another
     controller or to the motherboard, you start FreeBSD and then install the
     driver.

This section includes these topics:

   o "Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers"

   o "Creating a FreeBSD Driver Diskett"

   o "Installing FreeBSD on Storage Managed by a MegaRAID Controller
	(Primary Storage)"

   o "Installing the Kernel Driver on a FreeBSD System that Boots from
      a Device NOT Managed by a MegaRAID Controller(Secondary Storage)"


Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers
-------------------------------

LSI drivers can be compiled from source files into the kernel as built-in
drivers or can be modules that are loaded by the operating system. Both
source files and modules are available from LSI, but modules with
current controller drivers are available for FreeBSD 7.4 and 8.2.

You can obtain the MegaRAID controller driver for FreeBSD from one of
these two sources:

   o LSI software CD-ROM
     This CD includes:
        Compiled and tested kernel driver modules for FreeBSD 7.4,
        located here:
           32-bit: components/7.4/x86
           64-bit: components/7.4/x86_64

        Compiled and tested kernel driver modules for FreeBSD 8.2,
        located here:
           32-bit: components/8.2/x86
           64-bit: components/8.2/x86_64

        Driver source files for FreeBSD 7.x and 8.x
        located here:
           components/src/mfi.tgz

   o LSI web site. You can download the latest compiled and tested driver
     modules and driver source files for FreeBSD from the LSI web site at
     http://www.lsi.com/channel/ChannelDownloads.


Creating a FreeBSD Driver Diskette
----------------------------------

You need a diskette drive if you are going to be installing FreeBSD on a VD
or drive managed by a MegaRAID controller card which becomes the boot
unit for which your version of FreeBSD does not have a built-in driver.

To create a driver diskette

     1 Insert a blank diskette and the LSI software CD into a FreeBSD
       installed system.

     2  For FreeBSD 7.4 Navigate to: components/7.4
        For FreeBSD 8.2 Navigate to: components/8.2

     3 Copy the appropriate driver to the diskette, i.e., driver from x86
       folder if you are installing a 32-bit FreeBSD, x86_64 folder if you
       are installing 64-bit FreeBSD.  You need the driver source from
       components/src/mfi.tgz if you are going to update the kernel with
       a new driver.


=======================================================================

Installing FreeBSD on Storage Managed by a MegaRAID Controller
(Primary Storage)
=======================================================================

     Use this procedure if your boot unit is going to be managed by the
     MegaRAID controller.

     It describes how to load the FreeBSD kernel driver module to enable boot
     device support and how to then compile the current drivers into the kernel
     from source files.

     Please, note that FreeBSD  - 6.1-9.X includes outdated LSI driver package.
     Thus, for a successful OS installation - primary and secondary - it is 
     paramount to substitute the packaged LSI driver before attempting an 
     installation.  Please see the instructions below.

Note: Due to an issue with LSI mpt driver in FreeBSD 7.x and 8.x, your Megaraid
      controllers may be impacted.    If the mpt driver issue occurs, the system 
      will generate a soft reset and hard reset errors on the bootup.  DVD will not
      install the OS.  To avoid the issue with mpt driver, you need to disable the
      mpt driver before install or boot your FreeBSD system until you exclude the
      mpt driver from the booting kernel.

Prerequisite: You need an OS Installation CD for
              FreeBSD 7.4 or FreeBSD 8.2 (x86 or amd64)

Note: This procedure is specific to FreeBSD 7.4 or FreeBSD 8.2 since it requires
      a compiled module.  For other versions of FreeBSD for which a compiled
      module is not supplied by LSI it is necessary to compile your own module
      from source files.
      See "Compiling and Loading the Driver as a Module using kldload 
          (dynamically loadable module)".

     1. Disconnect all SCSI, ATA, and SAS devices in the system, except the CD
        or DVD and hard drives connected to the MegaRAID controller.

     2. Create the RAID VDs on the MegaRAID controller using WebBIOS, or
        Preboot Cli.

     3. Insert the diskette containing mfi.ko module into the diskette drive.

     4. At the FreeBSD boot menu, select 6 "Escape to loader prompt."

     5. At the loader prompt.

        To disable the mpt driver, type the following at the prompt:

        OK: set hint.mpt.0.disable=1
        OK: set hint.mpt.1.disable=1

        To load a new driver from a diskette drive:

        OK: load disk0:mfi.ko

Note_1: If you have multiple devices/units for OS installation, and the device/unit
        that you want to use for the installation is not disk0, please change disk0 
        to the appropriate number, i.e. disk1 or disk5, etc.

Note_2: Remember, at this point the old driver is not used but will still be 
        installed as a part of the new installation.  The installed kernel will 
        have to be rebuilt.

     6. Continue with the installation by typing.

	OK: boot


     7. Install the FreeBSD OS - including kernel source.
	Please, remember including kernel source files is critical.	
	Remove the FreeBSD installation CD, and reboot.

     8. On the bootup repeat step 5-6. Upon boot, continue with the instruction 
        in  the section of "Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source" for 
        statically linked module.

 
=======================================================================

Installing the Kernel Driver on a FreeBSD System that Boots from
      a Device NOT Managed by a MegaRAID Controller(Secondary Storage)

=======================================================================

     Use the steps in this section if FreeBSD boots from a device NOT managed by a 
     MegaRAID controller, but MegaRAID controller is or will be present on the system 
     and used for managing secondary storage.

     When you use the VD managed by the MegaRAID controller for secondary storage, 
     you do not need to use a driver diskette for driver installation.

     Please, note that FreeBSD  - 6.1-9.X includes outdated LSI driver package.
     Thus, for a successful OS installation - primary and secondary - it is paramount 
     to substitute the packaged LSI driver before attempting an installation.
     Please see the instructions below.

Note: Due to an issue with LSI mpt driver in FreeBSD 7.x and 8.x, your Megaraid
      controllers may be impacted.  To avoid the issue with mpt driver, you may 
      need to disable the mpt driver before install or boot your FreeBSD system
      until you exclude the mpt driver from the installed kernel.  If the mpt 
      driver is not removed, the system will generate a soft reset and hard 
      reset errors on the bootup.  DVD will not load.

Tip: Install FreeBSD on the drive attached to the motherboard before installing
     the MegaRAID controller. This avoids the possibility of installing to the
     wrong drive or unit.

     1 Get the latest driver source files for your version of FreeBSD.
       See "Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers".


A. System does not include an LSI controller before the OS installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Install FreeBSD - including kernel source - on a motherboard attached drive. 
        Please, remember including kernel source files is critical.

     2. After the OS installation, please reboot.

     3. Follow the instructions for driver installation in 

        "Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source" for Statically Linked
        Module,  or
 
        "Compiling and Loading the Driver as a Module using kldload" (for Dynamically 
         Loadable Module).

     4. Once FreeBSD is installed and the driver is updated, power down the system and 
        install the MegaRAID controller. For assistance, see the installation guide
        that came with the controller.


B. System includes a Megaraid controller before the OS installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Begin the installation process. 

     2. As the DVD loads, the user is offered boot options.

     3. Choose #6: Escape to prompt
 
	To disable the mpt driver, type the following at the prompt:

        OK: set hint.mpt.0.disable=1
        OK: set hint.mpt.1.disable=1
        OK: boot

     4. Proceed with the installation on a disk attached to the motherboard.
           Be sure to install the full FreeBSD source.

     5. After the OS installation, follow the instructions for driver installation in

        "Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source" for Statically Linked
        Module,  or
 
        "Compiling and Loading the Driver as a Module using kldload" (for Dynamically 
         Loadable Module).





Updating Drivers under FreeBSD
==============================

     Drivers can be updated either from source files or with driver modules.

     Using source files, you can compile drivers into the kernel or you can
     create modules for versions of FreeBSD for which LSI does not supply
     modules.

     This section includes these topics:

        o "Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source"

        o "Compiling and Loading the Driver as a Module using kldload" (dynamically 
          loadable module)

        o "Updating the MegaRAID Kernel Driver Module Under FreeBSD"
     
     
Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source 
----------------------------------------------

     Use this procedure if you wish to update your kernel from driver source files
     for both dynamically loadable module and statically linked module.  To obtain 
     source files, see "Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers".

     1. Make sure that kernel source has been installed on the system.
        The kernel sources are in the /usr/src/sys directory.

     2. Proceed to the /usr/sys/dev/ directory
	If a directory with the name "mfi" already exists, move it to some other
	folder.  For example:

       	 # mv /usr/src/sys/dev/mfi /root/mfi.backup

     3. Proceed to the /usr/sys/modules/ directory
	If a directory with the name "mfi" already exists, move it to some other
	folder.  For example:

       	 # mv /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi /root/mfi_module.backup	

     4. Unpack mfi.tgz then move the *.c and *.h files to /usr/src/sys/dev/mfi 
        and move the Makefile to /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi.  For example:

         # cd /usr/src/sys/dev
         # tar -x -f mfi.tgz
         # mv mfi/Makfile /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi/.

     5. At this point, proceed to 
	/usr/src/sys/i386/conf if you are running a 32bit version of FreeBSD
	/usr/src/sys/amd64/conf if you are running a 64bit version of FreeBSD

        a. Open your current configuration file: (GENERIC, MYKERNEL, SMP, or PAE
           or custom config), with vi or other editor.

           Comment out the following lines by placing '#' at the beginning of the line:

           #device   cbb   # cardbus (yenta) bridge
           #device   mpt   # LSI-Logic MPT-Fusion

           For a dynamically loadable module
	   ---------------------------------

	   Comment out the following line by placing '#' at the beginning of the line.

           #device   mfi   # LSI MegaRAID SAS

           For a statically linked module
	   ------------------------------

	   make sure following line is NOT commented out.

           device   mfi   # LSI MegaRAID SAS

        b. Save changes.

        c. In /usr/src/sys/conf/files add the following entries after the entries 
           for "dev/mfi/mfi_cam.c":

           dev/mfi/mfi_syspd.c   optional mfi

           For the 4.xx mfi driver with Thunderbolt support, also add the following:

           dev/mfi/mfi_fp.c      optional mfi
           dev/mfi/mfi_tbolt.c   optional mfi

        d. Save changes.

        e. To compile the kernel, go to /usr/src directory and type the following if 
           your current configuration is MYKERNEL.

           # cd /usr/src
           # make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL

        f. To install the new kernel, type the following if your current configuration 
           is MYKERNEL.

           # make installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL

           The new kernel will be copied to the /boot/kernel directory.
           The old kernel will be moved to the /boot/kernel.old directory.
           
     6. Reboot your system.

       When the system reboots, the new kernel driver module will load
       automatically.
       
       

Compiling and Loading the Driver as a Module using kldload (dynamically linked module)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     If you want to use a driver module and LSI does not supply one for your
     version of FreeBSD, use the following procedure. If you just want to
     install an LSI-supplied module, see "Updating the MegaRAID Kernel Driver
     Module Under FreeBSD".
     
     Note: You can only use kldload to load the driver as a module if your boot
           drive is attached to the mother board and is not managed by the
           MegaRAID controller.

     To compile the driver as a module
     
     1. Boot to FreeBSD.

     2. Obtain driver source files, see "Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers".

     3. Prepare your kernel is prepared for Dynamically Loadable Module described in

        "Updating the Kernel with the New Driver Source" 
        
     4. To build the mfi.ko module:

        # cd /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi
        # make

        The mfi.ko module is created in /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi.

     5. Load the kernel driver module

        # cd /usr/src/sys/modules/mfi
        # kldload -v ./mfi.ko

     6. If you wish to load the driver automatically on the bootup - but still 
        be linked dynamically:

         a. copy mfi.ko into the boot folder

            cp /sys/modules/mfi/mfi.ko /boot/kernel/mfi.ko
            (backup the old module if you wish to revert back)

         b. add the line 'mfi_load="YES"' to the file /boot/loader.conf


Updating the MegaRAID Kernel Driver Module Under FreeBSD
--------------------------------------------------------

     The following steps describe how to update the MegaRAID driver with a
     kernel driver module under FreeBSD.
     
     Make a backup of your original driver before updating in case you need
     to revert back to it.  However, you will not be able to revert back to
     the original driver if you are booting from that VD.

     1. Obtain the driver, see "Obtaining LSI FreeBSD Drivers".

     2. Make a backup of any critical data prior to updating the MegaRAID driver.

     3. Change the directory to the location with the driver.
     
        Copy the driver into /boot/kernel.
        Make sure the module version matches the FreeBSD version. If the
        versions don't match there could be a kernel panic.

     4. Load the driver.

        # kldload -v mfi.ko

        If storage is present, you should see information in the system
        log (usually, /var/log/messages).

     5. If you wish to load the driver automatically every time the system is
        rebooted, add the line 'mfi_load="YES"' to the file /boot/loader.conf
